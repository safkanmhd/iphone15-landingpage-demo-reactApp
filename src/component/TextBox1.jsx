        iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to feature an aerospace‑grade titanium
        design, using the same alloy that spacecraft use for missions to Mars.
        
        Titanium has one of the best strength‑to‑weight ratios of any metal,
        making these our lightest Pro models ever. You’ll notice the difference
        the moment you pick one up.
