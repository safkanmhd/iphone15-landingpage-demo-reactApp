        A new Dynamic Island display cutout that replaces the notch. The
        Dynamic Island will house the TrueDepth camera sensor for Face ID and
        the front-facing camera.A new 48MP main camera sensor, which
        will allow for higher resolution photos and videos. A new
        A16 Bionic chip, which will be faster and more efficient than the A15
        Bionic chip in the iPhone 14. A USB-C port instead of a
        Lightning port. This will make it easier to transfer data between the
        iPhone and other devices, and it will also make it possible to use the
        same cable to charge the iPhone and other devices, such as Macs and
        iPads.A new design, with a more durable frame and a new finish.
